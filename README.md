# IT-Waves

A retro horror game where you hunt a single snake-like monstrosity across 20 procedurally generated waves. The snake escapes when damaged enough (waves 1-19), forcing you to chase it through increasingly difficult arenas. On Wave 20, you finally defeat it.

## Game Overview

**IT-Waves** is a top-down arcade horror shooter inspired by classic games like Centipede. You're frozen in fear at the center of the screen, able only to aim and shoot as a sinister snake and its minions close in. Each wave increases the difficulty—more enemies, closing fog, and a relentless snake that won't stop until Wave 20.

### Core Gameplay
- **20 Waves**: Progress through increasingly difficult waves
- **Snake Boss**: A segmented snake that moves in wave patterns across a grid
- **Wave Completion**: Damage the snake enough and it escapes, starting the next wave with one additional segment
- **Final Battle**: Wave 20 transforms the snake into a mega head boss—defeat it to win
- **Instant Death**: Any contact with enemies or the snake kills you instantly
- **Score System**: Earn points by destroying enemies and boxes; score is saved only when you complete a wave

### Enemies
- **Snake**: The main antagonist with grid-based wave movement, growing longer each wave
- **Crawler**: Moves in bursts (slow/fast) with diagonal or lateral patterns, avoiding obstacles
- **Skitterer**: Constant medium-speed movement with zig-zag patterns toward the player

### Power-Ups
Hidden **Treasure Boxes** spawn throughout the game.

### Environmental Hazards
- **Destructible Boxes**: Spawn when the snake is hit; block movement and can be destroyed for points
- **Closing Fog**: Progressively shrinks the playable area.
